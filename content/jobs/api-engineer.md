This job combines the sexiest language with a slightly less sexy objective for an overall attractiveness quotient of still pretty neat. 

Specifically, being an API engineer at LBRY involves creating and modifying web-based API endpoints in Go. These endpoints are used for everyone from analytics and user-databasing to reward disbursement and more.

This is the only closed source project at LBRY. Competence in creating sane, secure, and well-structured API signatures is required, as is a mind for security. Strong knowledge of SQL and data structures is also necessary. This work involves interactions with blockchain, but no direct work on the LBRY blockchain or protocol.
