This position involves working directly on the LBRY [blockchain](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd), written in C++.

Competence with cryptography, security, and networks is mandatory. Experience with blockchain is beneficial but not required.

Blockchain work is like being a goalkeeper: good work goes under-appreciated, but mistakes are catastrophic. It's helpful if you're the kind of masochist that enjoys this.
